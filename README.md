# Hello world! 👋

I’m _Alex_, a programmer excited about the vast land of _web development_.

🌐

I am currently a student at [Amherst College](https://www.amherst.edu/) learning all the neat computer science theory there is. Here, I also engage in other fields, such as my favorite, environmental studies. I am currently exploring the ways I can intertwine my computer science skills and interests + understanding of environmental issues.

Outside the classroom, I'm reading articles, working through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), and planning + building web apps to hone my web dev skills. As of right now, the latest web technology I’ve picked up is React and I am constantly looking for more project ideas or resources to continue learning.

Since I'm usually busy being a student, I also care a ton about productivity apps like [Todoist](https://www.todoist.com/) and a cool, new one, [Superlist](https://www.superlist.com/), that make my life much less stressful. The plan is to develop my own task manager app ideas after becoming familiar enough with a full tech stack.

Below, you can see some of the technologies I've worked with!

### 💻 Programming languages and technologies

```python
web_stack = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript', 'React.js', 'Node.js', 'Vite']
leetcoding = ['Python']

# Needed to complete my stack.
to_learn = deque()
to_learn.append('MongoDB')
to_learn.append('Express.js')
```

### 💬 Contact me!

I'm always eager to talk to other CS-enthusiasts who may be starting out or are well into their journey. Feel free to reach out and ask or say anything! _I recently started a blog on Medium to share the more personal aspects of my software development journey in a more creative way! Check it out if you can!_
