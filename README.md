# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is *Alex*. I am a *web developer* because I'm obsessed with coding and I care about design. For years now, I've been particularly passionate about applications that not only aid, but serve to elevate the student learning experience. The goal is to learn enough to start making my **own** applications.

Some of my favorites:
- Notion
- Todoist
- Google Calendar
- Goodnotes


### ðŸŒ± What I'm learning:

Front-end development:

- Semantic HTML elements
- DOM manipulation with JavaScript
- CSS Flexbox

### ðŸ’ª Things I'm improving

- Writing clean and useful Git commits
- Giving functions *one* responsiblity and extracting any extra code out
- Writing semantic HTML

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about...
- My process learning of self-studying web development (I owe a lot of it to [**The Odin Project**](https://www.theodinproject.com/about)).
- The college application process as a first-gen student.
- What it's like studying computer science and math at Amherst College.
