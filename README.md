# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm *Alex*, a programmer that recently stumbled into the vast land of ðŸŒ² **web app development** ðŸŒ². 

Right now, I'm studying computer science at [Amherst College](https://www.amherst.edu) where I'm learning all the neat CS theory. Outside of the classroom, I'm reading through articles, working through [*The Odin Project*](https://www.theodinproject.com/about), and planning + building web apps to practice my web dev skills. I'm currently very immersed in learning everything I can about creating web apps and I'm always seeking to learn more. I care a ton about productivity tools, learning apps, study methods, and everything related to **student-learning**. With my web dev abilities, the goal is to create useful applications that make student's lives *a lot* less stresful.

### ðŸ’» Programming Languages:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (*the web dev essentials*)
- Java (*my school's preferred language, and my favorite* ðŸ˜„)
- Python (*the first language I really used*).

### ðŸ’¬ Contact me:

I'm always eager to talk to other CS-enthusiasts who may be starting out or are well into their journey. Feel free to reach out and ask or say anything!
