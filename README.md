# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Alex**, a programmer that's excited about the vast land of ðŸŒ² _web development_ ðŸŒ².

Right now, I'm studying computer science at [Amherst College](https://www.amherst.edu) where I'm learning all the neat CS theory. Outside of the classroom, I'm reading through articles, working through [_The Odin Project_](https://www.theodinproject.com/about), and planning + building web apps to practice my web dev skills.

Most of the time, I'm a _busy_ student, so I care a ton about productivity apps like [Todoist](https://www.todoist.com) and a cool, new one: [Superlist](https://www.superlist.com/) to help me manage my workloads. Recently, I've fallen in love with environmental studies and looking for ways to contribute my skills to the field.

-   Web dev: `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `React.js`, `Node.js`
